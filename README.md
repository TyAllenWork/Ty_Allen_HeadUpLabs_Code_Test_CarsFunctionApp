# Ty_Allen_HeadUpLabs_Code_Test_CarsFunctionApp

Hi there!

This app was created using Visual Studio 2019.

The storage method used is in-memory.

A Cars list is initialised when the app runs and is populated with 3 cars.

I went through a few refreshers/tutorials for this but I wasn't able to achieve all functionality. 
The Azure function runs without errors and the CreateCar and GetAllCars methods are working, however, the DeleteCar and UpdateCar methods do not work due to a conflict with the Id property in the Car class model. I spent a bit too much time trying to debug & find work arounds, so I decided to leave it there.

Also, I wasn't able to get the postman test collection working properly as I'm not very familiar with postman apart from perfoming basic requests (the Test Results state: "There was an error in evaluating the test script:  TypeError: Cannot read property 'json' of undefined").

Thanks for your consideration.
